# Poke finder

Welcome to my Poke finder, a pokedex flutter app! This project, initially developed as my first-ever
project, is a mobile application built using Flutter. The app is designed to provide users with an
immersive experience of exploring and discovering information about Pokemon. I am currently in the
process of rewriting it to improve the source code.

## Features

- **Pokemon List:** Browse through a list of Pokemon, each showcasing its name, image, and basic details.

- **Detailed Pokemon Information:** Select a specific Pokemon to view detailed information, including its type, height, weight, and abilities.

- **Search Functionality:** Easily find your favorite Pokemon using the search feature.

## Development Details

- **Flutter Version:** 3.16.5
- **Design Framework:** Utilizes Material Design 3 as the base for a modern and
visually appealing interface.
- **PokeAPI:** Data is sourced from [PokeAPI v2](https://pokeapi.co/), an extensive database 
providing information about Pokemon species, abilities, and more.
